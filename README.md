## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Cart Merge Functionality Improvements

We've made several improvements to the cart functionality, particularly focusing on the anonymous cart merging feature:

### Backend Improvements

1. **Transaction-based Merging**: The `mergeAnonymousCart` method now uses a Prisma transaction for atomic operations, ensuring that all cart items are processed together or none at all.

2. **Pre-validation of All Items**: Before making any changes to the database, all items are validated to ensure they exist, are active, and have sufficient stock.

3. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages are now provided when merging fails, with specific reasons for each item that couldn't be merged.

4. **Optimized Database Queries**: Reduced redundant database queries by validating all items first, then processing the valid ones.

5. **Improved Logging**: Enhanced logging for both successful operations and failures to help with debugging.

6. **Proper additionalInfo Handling**: We now correctly handle additionalInfo metadata for cart items.

### Frontend Improvements

1. **Standardized Field Names**: Consistently use `variantId` instead of mixing `variantId` and `productVariantId`.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error extraction from API responses with specific error messages shown to users.

3. **Debounce Protection**: Added debouncing to prevent multiple rapid merge operations when users log in.

4. **Proper Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types to match actual API response structures.

5. **Optimized API Calls**: Removed redundant backend calls and improved the cart sync logic flow.

6. **Extended Timeout for Merge Operations**: Doubled the timeout for merge operations since they might take longer than standard requests.

7. **Improved localStorage Management**: Better handling of localStorage to prevent unnecessary storage operations.

The cart system now provides a more reliable, consistent, and user-friendly experience when merging anonymous carts after user login.
